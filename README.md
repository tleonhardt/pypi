# PyPI Flask clone
This is code from following along with the 
[Building data-driven web apps with Flask and SQLAlchemy](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/details/building-data-driven-web-applications-in-python-with-flask-sqlalchemy-and-bootstrap)
course from [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm).

Here is the [parent GitHub repo](https://github.com/talkpython/data-driven-web-apps-with-flask) for the course.

I just started though, so I am not very far along.
